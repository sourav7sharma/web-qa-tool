## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/web-qa-tool.git
cd web-qa-tool
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Create .env file:

env
Copy
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
Configuration
Get your OpenAI API key

Add it to either:

.env file (recommended)

Usage
Run the application:

bash
Copy
streamlit run qa_tool.py

Example workflow:

Copy
URLs: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence
https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence

Question: 
"What are the main types of AI mentioned in these articles?"
How It Works
Content Ingestion:

Web scraping with BeautifulSoup

Text cleaning (removes scripts/styles)

Content chunking (max 2000 characters per chunk)

Question Answering:

TF-IDF vectorization for relevance scoring

GPT-3.5 Turbo with strict context constraints

Source URL attribution

Limitations
Limited to ~10k characters per URL

Basic TF-IDF relevance (no vector DB)

Depends on website structure for scraping

OpenAI API costs apply ($0.50/1M tokens)
